# UnovaLocationData

UnovaLocationData is a Java program designed to facilitate easy searching through the Encounter Data for Generation 5 Pok√©mon games, including Pokemon Black, Pokemon White, Pokemon Black 2, and Pokemon White 2. The program, currently in development, aims to provide a user-friendly GUI with various filter options for efficiently navigating through the encounter data.

## Installation

As of now, the only way to use this program is to clone the repository and run it using Java. In the future, there are plans to create a standalone JAR or similar distribution method.

## Usage

Once the GUI is implemented, users will be able to select various filters using dropdown menus and then press a button to display encounter entries with the selected filters applied. For now however, the only way to use this program is to clone it and run it with java yourself.
